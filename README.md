Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
This system helpful for the farmers in
making decisions about which crops has to grow in their 
fields. This system uses various data sources such as soil 
properties and weather conditions data to predict the best crop 
options for a particular farm location. This system uses different 
machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, Logistic 
regression and random forests, to analyse the data and 
recommendation the crops. The proposed system helpful to the 
farmers to maximize their profits.
